The main advantage they have realized is that they are approved and regulated by the SEC as an alternative trading service.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Being regualted is a major advantage and it has proven its ability to execute. Based on publicly information it is likely not profitable, but being backstopped by a major ecommerce company will likely afford it a substantially longer runway than its peers.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I would continue to capitalize on the global real estate market. Real estate is the largest single asset class globally, with over $2 Trillion dollars in estimated value. Real estate also has huge intermediation costs relative to other markets, with lawyers and brokers collecting premimum levels of compensation due to the historical opacity and localized nature of the industry.  

Beyond real estate, another natural extension of the platform would be to infrastrucutre assets. Infrastructure assets are highly illiquid, involve immense transaction costs, and currently only accesible to highly specialized institutional investors.

Lastly, I would advise them to continue efforts to exapnd the platform outside of the United States through the listing of mature, professionally run emerging market businesses. Companies with this profile have exceptional return potential, particulalry from a value perspective given the asset inflation that has occured in most major public markets in the wake of the financial crisis. However, realiizing this final goal is likely long term given the regulatory challenges that would likely be encountered.
